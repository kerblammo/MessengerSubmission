# TheMessenger
This is an instant messaging application developed for a school project. It allows a user to create a simple profile, log in to the application, and both send and receive messages.

## Getting Started
Using the application is a bit tricky, so outlined are some steps to get things working.

### Prerequisites
* Visual Studio or similar IDE with debugger
* Connection string to class's Microsoft Azure Database

### Starting the Application
Open the TheMessenger.sln file to open the program in your IDE of choice. Then run the program.

## Tests
There aren't any. While this is horrible, it's also something that hasn't been coverd by the curriculum.
